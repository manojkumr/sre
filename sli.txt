1. Availabiltiy - The ability to reach Sign and associated microservices and perform signature workflows.
   Source - ELB/Splunk
   Formula - Number of sucussfull request(e.g response code 200, 403) / Total number of valid request
2. Response Time - The elapsed system response time for web or API actions.
   Source - NewRelic
   Formula - Direct from newrelic. (99%ile < 300ms, 95%ile < 250ms, 90%ile < 150ms)
3. Throughput - The number of agreements created each minute on each shard
   Source - Database by Query/Synthetic monitoring
   Formula - Number of agreements created/nmins per shard > 1 agreement per n mins

DRE:
1. Availabiltiy - Ability to server legitmiate request 
   Source - Custom query/Datadog availbilty monitoring
   Formula - (Number of sucessful connections over time)
2. Response Time - Time required to serve the queries from sucessful connections
   Source - Datadog
   Formula - 
    Write latency should (99%ile < 200ms, 95%ile < 150ms, 90%ile < 100ms)
    Read latency should (99%ile < 150ms, 95%ile < 100ms, 90%ile < 80/ms)

3. Error rate - Deadlocks and Lockwait timeout erros should be less     
   Source - Databse Logs
   Formula 
   -  Lockwait timeout errors should be less than 0.001%
   -  Dead locks should be less than .0001% of queires
4. Freshness - Replication lag between slave and Master should be less than 
    Formula: Lag should be less < 60 sec
